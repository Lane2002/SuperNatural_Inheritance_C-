Supernatural Inheritance
At the Codecademy Guild of the Supernatural, there are three ranks of magicians. They rank from least to most powerful: Pupils, Mages, and Archmages. In this project you’ll be developing a system in C# to track the weather magicians in the guild and their spells.

Pupils have a title and can create one weak wind storm.
Mages have a title and can create a weak wind storm and a weak rain storm.
Archmages have a title and can create a weak wind storm, a strong rain storm, and a strong lightning storm.
Notice anything shared in these ranks? If we created a class for each type of magician, we would have a lot of duplicated code. For example, every magician has a title and wind storm. To avoid duplication, we’ll use inheritance.

Pupil is the base class
Mage inherits from Pupil
Archmage inherits from Mage
Archmage inherits from Mage, which inherits from Pupil

We’ll also need a Storm class, which stores the essence, strength, and the title of the magician who created it.

Let’s get started!

Storm
1.
We’ll start by defining the Storm class.

In Storm.cs, create an empty class named Storm.

2.
Define three automatic properties. Each one should have a public getter and private setter:

string Essence - the type of storm, like wind or rain
bool IsStrong- true if the storm is strong
string Caster - the title of the magician casting the storm

3.
Define a constructor that takes three arguments, one for each property.

In the body of the constructor, use those arguments to set the property values.

4.
We’ll need some way to print a Storm object to the console.

Define a public Announce() method that returns a string. The string should use all three properties. For example if a weak wind storm was cast by Zul’rajas, the string would be:

Zul'rajas cast a weak wind storm!

5.
Test your class! In Program.cs in Main(), construct a new Storm. It should:

have "wind" essence
NOT be strong
be cast by "Zul'rajas"
After constructing the new object, call Announce() and print the result to the console.

Pupil
6.
Next, we’ll define the Pupil class.

In Pupil.cs, define a class named Pupil with these two members:

a string Title, with public getter and private setter. This represents the name of the pupil
a constructor with one argument, that sets the Title property

7.
Give the Pupil its single spell: a CastWindStorm() method. It should be public with return type Storm. In the body of the method, construct a new Storm object and return it.

Remember that this is a weak wind storm cast by the pupil.


Stuck? Get a hint
8.
Test your class! In Program.cs, construct a new Pupil named Mezil-kree.

After constructing a new object, call CastWindStorm() and store the result in a variable. Use Announce() to check that it is a weak wind storm.


Stuck? Get a hint
Mage
9.
The next rank, Mage, also has a Title property and CastWindStorm() method. It also has a new CastRainStorm() method. Instead of writing the first two members again, we can inherit them from Pupil.

In Mage.cs, define an empty Mage class that inherits from Pupil.


Stuck? Get a hint
10.
Add a Mage constructor with one string argument. It should call the base constructor with that same argument.


Stuck? Get a hint
11.
Give the Mage a new spell: CastRainStorm(). It should be public with return type Storm. In the body of the method, construct a new Storm object and return it.

Remember that this is a weak rain storm cast by the mage.


Stuck? Get a hint
12.
Test your class! In Program.cs, construct a new Mage named Gul’dan.

After constructing a new object, call CastRainStorm() and store the result in a variable. Use Announce() to check that it is a weak rain storm.


Stuck? Get a hint
Archmage
13.
The next rank, Archmage, also has a Title property and CastWindStorm() method. On top of that, it overrides CastRainStorm() and has a new CastLightningStorm() method. Instead of writing the first two members again, we can inherit them from Mage.

In Archmage.cs, define an empty Archmage class that inherits from Mage.


Stuck? Get a hint
14.
Add an Archmage constructor with one string argument. It should call the base constructor with that same argument.


Stuck? Get a hint
15.
Override the CastRainStorm() spell. Just like the one in Mage, it should be public with return type Storm. In the body of the method, construct a new Storm object and return it.

This time it is a strong rain storm cast by the archmage.

You may see an error here: we’ll fix it in the next step.


Stuck? Get a hint
16.
Since the CastRainStorm() method is overridden, it must be marked virtual in Mage. Do that now.


Stuck? Get a hint
17.
Add one more spell in Archmage.cs: CastLightningStorm(). It should be public with return type Storm. In the body of the method, construct a new Storm object and return it.

This time it is a strong lightning storm cast by the archmage.


Stuck? Get a hint
18.
Test your class! In Program.cs, construct a new Archmage named Nielas Aran.

After constructing a new object, call CastRainStorm() and CastLightningStorm() and store the results in variables. Use Announce() to make sure they are correct!

Extensions
19.
Well done! You’ve created four new classes. Three of them are in an inheritance hierarchy: Archmage inherits from Mage, which inherits from Pupil. Each class has at least one method that uses the fourth class, Storm.

If you’d like more practice, try these optional challenges:

In Program.cs, store the Storm objects in an array instead of separate variables.
Add a string Origin property and a new constructor to the Pupil class. The constructor should have two parameters, one for Title and one for Origin. Add a similar constructor to Mage and Archmage. In other words, you should be able to run this code in Program.cs:
Pupil p = new Pupil("Mezil-kree", "Icecrown");
Mage m = new Mage("Gul'dan", "Draenor");
Archmage a = new Archmage("Nielas Aran", "Stormwind");
3. Define an abstract class Spell with Essence, IsStrong, and Caster properties and an abstract Announce() method. Make Storm inherit from Spell. A Spell.cs file is included in the workspace — find it by clicking the folder icon at the top of the text editor.
